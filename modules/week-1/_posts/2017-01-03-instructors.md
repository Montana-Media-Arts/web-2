## Dr. Michael Musick

I am the professor who built and is now iterating this course. I am also the instructor of record for this course. If you have any significant problems, administrative or technical, you will need to come to me about them.

I am excited to work with you, and guide you through the journey of beginning to code!

Please feel free to leverage my office hours. I would love it if each and everyone of you who are in Missoula could come by sometime in the first few weeks to introduce yourself. For those of you who are distance learners, please take a moment to look at my website ([michaelmusick.com](http://michaelmusick.com)) and consider sending me an email about yourself, along with something to help me get to know you better, like your own website, or links to your creative work.

With all of that being said, I want to point out that I am incredibly busy. I will work to respond to your questions and problems as quickly as I can. E-mail is the second best way to get a hold of me. I will check my e-mail at least once per day. My office hours are **THE BEST** way to get help from me. They will be posted and updated in the ["Instructors"]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/) tab of this website.

## Teaching Assistant - TBA

We will have a Teaching Assistant. When this person contact is available, I will email the class. I will also post their information in the ["Instructors"]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/) tab.

If you are unable to solve problems on your own or through the course "issues forum" (more to come on that later), you should e-mail the TA for help.

## Lab Assistants

In addition to the TA, Media Arts continues to provide help to all online students through the 127 Media Arts Lab in McGill. This lab is staffed by wonderful MFA students who are prepared to answer your questions, or help you figure out how to answer your questions.

Lab hours, along with Lab Assistant information will be posted in the ["Help"]({{site.baseurl}}/help/) tab.
