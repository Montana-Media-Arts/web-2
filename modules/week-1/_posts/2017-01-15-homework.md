# Homework 1<br/>Single Personal Page

As a review and way of launching you back into web development, you are to build a single-page, static-site, that briefly describes you, for your first homework assignment.

<br />


This site should;

- be visually appealing, aesthetically
- include a ["hero image"](https://envato.com/blog/exploring-hero-image-trend-web-design/)
- utilize [Mobile-First](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/a-hands-on-guide-to-mobile-first-design/), [Response Web Design (RWD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) principles
    - If you need a refresher on Responsive Web Design, look at the [google course](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/responsive/)
    - Utilize at least two separate [_break points_](https://responsivedesign.is/strategy/page-layout/defining-breakpoints/)
- use [inter-page linking](https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html40-970917/struct/links.html)

You should also have at least three sections. At a minimum, this should include;

1. The "hero-image"
2. An information section about yourself
3. At least one additional section that describes something else of interest to you
    - The example site describes this course.

<br />


With respect to the file structure, the site should;

- Exist as the top-level of your new repository gh-pages site.
    - i.e. `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME/`
- In the top-level of your repo directory, you should place the 'index.html' document.
- All other resources for this site, along with the weekly 'readme.md' response should be located in directory labeled `HW-1`, which is also in the root level of the main repo directory.
    - This means your directory structure might look something like;

```
/
├── HW-1
│   ├── imgs
│   │   ├── hero-image-2.jpg
│   │   └── hero-image.jpg
│   ├── readme.md
│   └── style.css
├── README.md
└── index.html
```


## Example

The following are links to a live example of this site and the associated repository.


| [**[Live Site Example]**](https://michaelmusick.github.io/441/) | [**[View on GitHub]**](https://github.com/michaelmusick/441/tree/HW-1/) | [**[Zip Download]**](https://github.com/michaelmusick/441/raw/HW-1/HW-1/HW-1.zip) |


> Note: You are welcome to look at code, snoop around, and see how I solved these problems. You should also examine the repository directory structure to understand what I am asking for "directory structure" - wise.

#### Embedded iframe Version

<div class="displayed_code_example">
    <div class="embed-responsive" style="padding-bottom:80%"><iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://michaelmusick.github.io/441/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div>


## Weekly Readme Response

Every homework assignment, you will write a readme document, describing your experience and response to the homework. This will be a standard part of all HW assignments. This can be considered as a technical report, in which you post documentation about how it went and what you did. Ideally something visual, some written thoughts, specifics of what you did, and code. If you are struggling with your problem and can't get things to work, you should feel free to put your energy into writing about what didn't work (and vent any frustrations!). This should be considered as a technical report. As such, these reports should be well formed, written with proper grammar/style, and edited. You will be marked down for poor writing.

Your response should be considerably longer than the example readme.md from the above links.

#### Markdown Assistance

If you do not know, or are wanting a refresher with Markdown please utilize the following resources.

- [Markdown info from 120](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-2/markup/)
- [GitHub Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)


## Submission

To submit your homework, copy and paste links to your;

1. active site
    - i.e. https://michaelmusick.github.io/441/
2. Homework repo directory
    - i.e. https://github.com/michaelmusick/441/tree/HW-1/

These should be placed in a new forum post in the "Week 1 HW Forum" on Moodle.
