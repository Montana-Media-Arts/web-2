This week we start to touch on abstract ideas about synchronicity and modularization of JS code.

For those of you who took [Creative Coding 1 - MART 120](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/), this is new material for you. We finished up with reviewing common techniques between both courses last week. So, give yourself plenty of time if the last few weeks of material seemed easy.

As always, stay in touch with me about how your work is going, and let me know if you are lost or confused.
