# JSON data structures

Before we explore what APIs are and how to use them. You first need to be introduced to a new data structure; JSON or JavaScript Object Notation.

JSON is a standardized method for storing and transporting unordered collections of data. This data is stored through _name:value_ pairs. Furthermore, the _values_ in JSON data can be;

- strings
- numbers
- booleans
- arrays
- or other nested JSON objects


<br />


JSON Objects, once in JavaScript (i.e. after being sent over from an API on a remote server), appear as JS objects. As such, they can be traversed and manipulated using standard JS object notation and techniques.

As an example, the following code creates a JS Object, which is also valid as JSON.

```js
let obj = {
    "someName" : "someValue",
    "firstName" : "Michael",
    "aPerson" : {
        "firstName" : "Mr.",
        "lastName" : "Peanutbutter"
    },
    "anArray" : [
        "zero",
        "one",
        "two"
    ]
}
```

Once this object is binded to the variable `obj`, we can navigate through it and access it unique values.

The following example creates the same object as above, but also demonstrates how to access values within the object.

<div id="jotted-demo-1" class="jotted-theme-stacked"></div>

<script>
    new Jotted(document.querySelector("#jotted-demo-1"), {
    files: [
        {
            type: "js",
            hide: false,
            url:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Montana-Media-Arts/441-WebTech/master/lecture_code/09/01_json_01/js_obj.js"
        }
    ],
    showBlank: false,
    showResult: false,
    plugins: [
        { name: 'ace', options: { "maxLines": 50 } },
        { name: 'console', options: { autoClear: true } },
        // { name: 'play', options: { firstRun: true } },
    ]
});
</script>
