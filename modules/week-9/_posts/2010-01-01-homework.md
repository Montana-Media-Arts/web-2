# Homework

For your homework this week, you should build a website that is reliant upon live data fetched from a Web-based API.

This project could be an extension of material you built from one of the lessons on the previous page. You are also welcome to find another API of interest to you and your work and incorporate it in such a way as they data is represented on the site you build.
