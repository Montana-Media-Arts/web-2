# Course Conclusions

I have enjoyed working with each of you this semester. I hope you have found this course valuable towards your growth as a web developer, creative technologist, & artist.

If you have any further questions about this course, please do not hesitate to contact me. I would be happy to talk with any and all of you.

Likewise, if you have questions regarding course advisement around creative coding, interactive art, web development, or sonic art for next semester, please send me a note. I would be happy to discuss the offerings I am aware of within Media Arts and how those may or may not be appropriate/applicable to your goals.

If you are instead considering transitions to the professional or artistic worlds and would like to discuss strategies to accomplish your goals, I would also be happy to find time to talk with you.


<br />

I hope that your coming break is peaceful and calm. If you have additional semesters at the University, I look forward to working with you more! If you are instead on your way out of the University, good luck and stay in touch with us.
